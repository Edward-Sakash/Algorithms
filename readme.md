# Exercise(Algo- Matplotlib):
# Task 1
install matplotlib
generate  with matplotlib the following graph:
 LogN
 N
 NlogN
 N_square
 N_exp
 N!
you can calculate with a list comprehension:
N_exp =  [math.exp(ele) for ele in sizes]
for y = exp(x)
Y = [2.718281828459045, 7.38905609893065, 20.085536923187668, 54.598150033144236]
X  = [1,2,3,4]

# Task 2
Plot a line graph to show the population growth of a city over a period of 5 years. The population data is given below:

Year Population
2018 100000
2019 110000
2020 120000
2021 130000
2022 140000

# Task 3
Bonus(Bar Plot):
Create a bar chart to compare the sales performance of different products for a company. The sales data for each product is given below:

Product A: $5000
Product B: $8000
Product C: $3000
Product D: $6000
Hint:
To solve this exercise, you'll need to import the Matplotlib library and use the bar function to create the bar chart.
define two lists, products and sales, to store the product names and sales data, respectively.
use the bar function to create a bar chart
pass products as the x-axis values and sales as the y-axis values.
add labels to the x-axis and y-axis using the xlabel and ylabel functions, respectively.
set the title of the chart using the title function.
 display the chart using the show function.
